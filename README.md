# Kepler Problem

Solution to the two body Kepler Problem in pure Haskell! Completely analytical (except for a series approximation for a couple of functions that are asymptotic at zero)!

Run with

`runhaskell EllipticalOrbit.hs`
`./plot.py`

or

`runhaskell HyperbolicOrbit.hs`
`./plot.py`

For the elliptical or hyperbolic cases respectively.
